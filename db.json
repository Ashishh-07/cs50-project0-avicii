        "event": "On 6 May 2015, Bergling released his rework of Nina Simone's version of \"Feeling Good\", composed in 1964 by the English songwriters Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. On 8 May 2015, Bergling previewed his song \"I'll Be Gone\" via episode 422 of Tiësto's Club Life Podcast which has a very similar instrumental to Liar Liar (Avicii by Avicii) albeit different vocals and chord progressions. It was leaked into the internet between 2013–2014 via the name \"Stars\" and is yet to be released. It also shares a similar drop to one of Bergling's ID's \"Black and Blue\". On 22 May 2015, Bergling premiered another single from Stories, \"Waiting for Love\". The track was co-produced by fellow DJ and producer Martin Garrix, and featured vocals from Simon Aldred of Cherry Ghost. On 25 May 2015, Bergling previewed three old tracks on episode 36 of his LE7ELS podcast: \"Tracks of My Tears\", \"Sorry Mr. Atari\" and \"Time to Get lll\", all of which are songs that Bergling had made years ago. \"Tracks of My Tears\" is the original version of Bergling's \"All You Need is Love\". On 27 May 2015, it was confirmed by a Swedish newspaper through an interview with Bergling that his sophomore album Stories would be released in late 2015."

        "event": "Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989, the son of Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén. He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight. He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, and Anton Körberg. Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16. In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label. He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style. By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were \"Sound of Now\", \"Muja\", \"Ryu\" and \"Even\". Bergling explained that the name Avicii means \"the lowest level of Buddhist hell\" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page. Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song \"Seek Bromance\", which reached the top 20 in several countries, including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden. He also remixed Nadia Ali's classic single \"Rapture\" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.\n"
