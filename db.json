        "event": "Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989, the son of Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén. He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight. He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, and Anton Körberg. Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16. In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label. He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style. By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were \"Sound of Now\", \"Muja\", \"Ryu\" and \"Even\". Bergling explained that the name Avicii means \"the lowest level of Buddhist hell\" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page. Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song \"Seek Bromance\", which reached the top 20 in several countries, including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden. He also remixed Nadia Ali's classic single \"Rapture\" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.\n"
