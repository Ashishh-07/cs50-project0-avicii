                        in 1964 by the English songwriters Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. On 8 May 2015, Bergling
                        previewed his song "I'll Be Gone" via episode 422 of Tiësto's Club Life Podcast which has a very
                        similar instrumental to Liar Liar (Avicii by Avicii) albeit different vocals and chord
                        progressions. It was leaked into the internet between 2013–2014 via the name "Stars" and is yet
                        to be released. It also shares a similar drop to one of Bergling's ID's "Black and Blue". On 22
                        May 2015, Bergling premiered another single from Stories, "Waiting for Love". The track was
                        co-produced by fellow DJ and producer Martin Garrix, and featured vocals from Simon Aldred of
                        Cherry Ghost. On 25 May 2015, Bergling previewed three old tracks on episode 36 of his LE7ELS
                        podcast: "Tracks of My Tears", "Sorry Mr. Atari" and "Time to Get lll", all of which are songs
                        that Bergling had made years ago. "Tracks of My Tears" is the original version of Bergling's
                        "All You Need is Love". On 27 May 2015, it was confirmed by a Swedish newspaper through an
                        interview with Bergling that his sophomore album Stories would be released in late 2015.

                        Anki Lidén. He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight. He had three siblings: David
                        Bergling, Linda Sterner, and Anton Körberg. Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began
                        making music at the age of 16. In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label. He
                        was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated
                        his distinct deep house style. By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was
                        releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja",
                        "Ryu" and "Even". Bergling explained that the name Avicii means "the lowest level of Buddhist
                        hell" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace
                        page. Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in
                        several countries, including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden. He
                        also remixed Nadia Ali's classic single "Rapture" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx
                        Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.

                        executive producer Ash Pournouri to start House for Hunger in 2011, a charity dedicated to
                        alleviating global hunger. The pair wanted to showcase the giving spirit fostered by the house
                        music community. Bergling explained, "You have to give something back. I am so fortunate to be
                        in the position where I can actually do that. I feel lucky every day when I wake up and am able
                        to do what I love and make a living." In addition to donating $1 million to Feeding America, a
                        charity founded by John van Hengel, House for Hunger has helped fund the efforts of The Feed
                        Foundation, started by Laura Bush, allowing it to distribute over 2 million school meals
                        throughout Africa. He also supported campaigns against human trafficking and gang violence when
                        he directed the videos for his tracks "For a Better Day" and "Pure Grinding".

                        release between Lewis and Bergling. In October 2011, Bergling released "Levels", which launched
